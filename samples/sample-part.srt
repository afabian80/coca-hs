LEVIATHAN

2
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:28,926
I'll have a smoke outside,
or I'll fall asleep.
"Son of a beach" - said Kolya.

3
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,559
OK. I'll be quick.

4
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,822
There they are...

5
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,384
Not making your quota, Sergeant?

6
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:08,984
Your license and registration.

7
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,883
Polished your badge today?

8
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,082
Stepanych will come see you today.
His carburettor broke again.

9
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:22,148
Again? I'm not a charity.

10
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,914
You know he'll make it up to you.

11
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:26,414
I can buy my own damn vodka.

12
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,280
Look,

13
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,279
he said he'll cover everything
for our trip: petrol,

14
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,512
food, guns.

15
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,645
I'm so excited,
I could wet my pants!

16
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:37,578
- Kolya...
- Pasha.

17
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,111
- It'll only take a second.
- I'm serious.

18
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,444
I can't today.

19
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,443
Tell him to come tomorrow.

20
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,242
- I will.
- All right.
