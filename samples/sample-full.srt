1
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,491
LEVIATHAN

2
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:28,926
I'll have a smoke outside,
or I'll fall asleep.

3
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,559
OK. I'll be quick.

4
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:48,822
There they are...

5
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:07,384
Not making your quota, Sergeant?

6
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:08,984
Your license and registration.

7
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,883
Polished your badge today?

8
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,082
Stepanych will come see you today.
His carburettor broke again.

9
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:22,148
Again? I'm not a charity.

10
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,914
You know he'll make it up to you.

11
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:26,414
I can buy my own damn vodka.

12
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,280
Look,

13
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:32,279
he said he'll cover everything
for our trip: petrol,

14
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,512
food, guns.

15
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,645
I'm so excited,
I could wet my pants!

16
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:37,578
- Kolya...
- Pasha.

17
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,111
- It'll only take a second.
- I'm serious.

18
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,444
I can't today.

19
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,443
Tell him to come tomorrow.

20
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:48,242
- I will.
- All right.

21
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,742
Say hi to the wife.

22
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,772
I'm sick of that Stepanych
and his truck.

23
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,172
Fucking cop...

24
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:08,704
Cheap bastard is always after me
to fix his rust bucket.

25
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:12,704
He can crawl around
underneath it himself.

26
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:17,369
Any corrupt traffic cop can afford
a good car after 5 years on the job.

27
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,102
Maybe he's an honest cop.

28
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:21,368
Yeah, and generous!

29
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,432
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

30
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,629
And where's your "good morning"?

31
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:54,794
I don't know.

32
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:58,060
Look for it, then.

33
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,027
Where?

34
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:07,192
Did you wash?
Go on, don't be an ape.

35
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:10,191
You're the ape.

36
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,457
What?

37
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,424
Nothing.

38
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,589
- Stop right there.
- Get lost.

39
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:22,355
- What did you say?
- Just what you heard.

40
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:25,688
Oh! They're here.

41
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,283
Dima, tell them to take me along.

42
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:52,916
What about school?
You have a test coming up. Go get ready.

43
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,082
Don't lie...

44
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,247
- Don't talk to your mum like that!
- She's not my mum!

45
00:10:10,178 --> 00:10:11,978
Difficult age...

46
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,111
You shouldn't hit him.

47
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,377
Just an affectionate slap.

48
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:18,743
I'm not driving him to school today.

49
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,709
He's been rude to me all morning.

50
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:25,241
I can't either. My friend's here.

51
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:29,608
He's your son. Up to you
whether he becomes a man or an ape.

52
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,940
Does he really have a test today?

53
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:34,939
Yes.

54
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:39,372
Kolya, just take him.
I can come along too.

55
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,738
He'd like that.

56
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:53,735
Hey, soldier of fortune,
you ready to go?

57
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:01,134
How've you been?

58
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:02,467
All right.

59
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,032
We're looking for a new place.

60
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:13,031
I've been saying
we should move out of town.

61
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,630
Away from this place.
He says nothing.

62
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:19,697
- Could you talk to him?
- Sure.

63
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,263
Can't I just wear it?

64
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:23,429
Give it back, Dad.

65
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:25,962
All right, I'll give it back.
Stop whining.

66
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,095
Thank you.

67
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,260
Go start the car.

68
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,760
You're driving.

69
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,026
Alone?

70
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,959
You wish.

71
00:11:38,093 --> 00:11:40,392
Dima and I are coming too.

72
00:11:42,158 --> 00:11:44,591
- But I'm driving, right?
- Yes, you.

73
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:50,556
Time out!

74
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,255
My own fault for coaching him.

75
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,187
A couple more years,
and he'll knock you out cold.

76
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,587
It's all good.

77
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:14,451
- I love you.
- I know.

78
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,683
Don't let him drive too fast!

79
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:46,778
Hello.

80
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:49,744
Hi. Kolya's taking Roma to school.

81
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,243
Come in. He'll be back soon.

82
00:12:51,343 --> 00:12:56,576
That's OK, I'll wait out here
and have a smoke.

83
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,730
Hello, Kolya.

84
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,896
Hey there. Car troubles again?

85
00:13:55,063 --> 00:13:57,695
Didn't Pasha tell you
that I can't today?

86
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,262
No. Why, what's up?

87
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:02,062
My friend is visiting from Moscow.

88
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:03,894
My court hearing is at noon,

89
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:07,261
and we still have
a few things to go over.

90
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:12,526
I'll do it tomorrow.

91
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:13,959
Come by in the morning.

92
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,259
Tomorrow?

93
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,191
- I'm Ivan Stepanych.
- Dima.

94
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,890
I promise. I'll fix her up -
good as new.

95
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,290
OK, Kolya, fair enough.

96
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,189
Tomorrow it is then.

97
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,422
He wasn't happy about that.

98
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,954
- Funny character.
- You think?

99
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,220
He's outlived two wives.

100
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,686
Fucking tyrant.

101
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:45,619
OK, my friends.

102
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,118
Over the last two months,
I dug up some dirt

103
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:52,251
on that bastard.

104
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:53,817
Got him by the balls?

105
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:55,883
Yep, it'll do some damage.

106
00:14:55,983 --> 00:14:59,849
- Doesn't look like much.
- So what now, how does it help?

107
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,282
Here's the deal:

108
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,381
I think today's ruling
won't be in our favour...

109
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:07,380
- Don't write us off yet.
- But...

110
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:11,679
We need him to think
what's best for him:

111
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,613
settle with us, or we go public.

112
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,746
- Meaning?
- Kolya, let him finish.

113
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:19,711
I want to know what he found.
A cannon can't bring that prick down!

114
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,811
No need for cannons.

115
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:24,277
We'll just gently tug him

116
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:25,576
by the balls.

117
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,976
I don't believe in that approach.
We've got to crush him.

118
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,409
- With a sledgehammer!
- No.

119
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,842
Only a subtle approach
works with his kind.

120
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:37,141
This here is our leverage. Facts.

121
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:39,707
- Let me see.
- Not just yet.

122
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:41,373
After the hearing.

123
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,172
- Why's that?
- Kolya...

124
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:46,972
Because you're a hothead.
No offense,

125
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,838
but you can fly off the handle
just like that.

126
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,738
And the last thing we need now
is a scandal.

127
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,570
Come on. I'm not crazy.

128
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,836
I have to know. You think
I'll just blurt out everything in court?

129
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,702
- Do you trust me, bro?
- Of course.

130
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,368
Then don't question me -
read it after.

131
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:10,100
Lilya, how about some tea?

132
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:20,198
Well, all right. I'll read it after.

133
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,031
Good man.

134
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:26,263
But you know,
you're bossing me around, junior.

135
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:28,097
And I don't like it.

136
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,162
Kolya, "junior" is what I was
in the army 20 years ago.

137
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,395
Why are you

138
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,661
waving these papers in my face then?

139
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:40,060
See for yourself then, chief.

140
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,227
Well, I've heard things about him.
Who hasn't, around here?

141
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,226
He's got blood dripping...

142
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,792
from his hands.

143
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,691
So why isn't he in prison
if you've got all this documented?

144
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,457
Because somebody up top needs him.

145
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,756
They've got all of them by the balls.

146
00:16:58,856 --> 00:17:01,723
Easier to manage that way.
It's all very simple.

147
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,322
Vadim's position is safe

148
00:17:05,422 --> 00:17:07,288
as long as he serves his purpose.

149
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:08,521
Or until he dies.

150
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,821
Or until someone lynches him.

151
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:13,553
Give me a break.
Who's going to lynch him?

152
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,486
You guys coming or what?

153
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:18,286
So let him sleep. Come alone.

154
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:22,851
I see.

155
00:17:24,384 --> 00:17:26,584
If there's no one
to watch him, fine.

156
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,849
I know.
I've just got other things on my mind.

157
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,382
I'll talk to you later.

158
00:17:33,516 --> 00:17:35,416
So what? Not coming?

159
00:17:35,516 --> 00:17:39,215
Pasha is asleep after his shift.
There's no one to watch the kid.

160
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:42,247
Last time they had an excuse too.
Some friends!

161
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:44,614
- What about yours?
- Mine are right here.

162
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,346
OK, Kolya, you win.

163
00:17:49,313 --> 00:17:51,079
My friends are shit.

164
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:52,978
- Sure are!
- Stop it, please.

165
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,044
Kolya, get a grip.
Watch your driving.

166
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,811
My driving!

167
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,143
Lilya...

168
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,176
I'm not saying anything.

169
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:28,104
Decree No. 1295 of the Pribrezhny
Town Administration

170
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:33,736
ordered the seizure from Mr Sergeyev
of a land parcel of 0.66 acres

171
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:36,935
cadastral number 28:136:254:2001,

172
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,002
along with the residential building,

173
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,934
automotive works shed,
repair garage and greenhouse.

174
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:46,400
Mr Sergeyev petitioned the Zagorye
District Court to repeal this Decree.

175
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:49,500
The Court ruled to deny the petition.

176
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:54,765
Mr Sergeyev then petitioned
Pribrezhny Town Court to appeal.

177
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:58,564
During proceedings, Mr Sergeyev
insisted the court ruling be revoked.

178
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:01,697
The Town Administration
rejected the appeal

179
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,863
and upheld the ruling
of the Zagorye District Court.

180
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:08,028
Mr Sergeyev states the initial ruling
violated procedural regulations

181
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:12,595
and therefore disputes the conclusion
that the seizure of the land parcel

182
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:14,527
is lawful.

183
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:20,126
He says the Administration did not
meet the deadline for notifying him

184
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,992
and violated the procedure
for determining the purchase price.

185
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,724
He also contends
that, when determining the price,

186
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:31,590
the court did not consider
an independent evaluation he submitted,

187
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,990
which values the property higher
than determined by the Administration.

188
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:36,322
Me also states
that the Administration

189
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:39,355
violated civil law.

190
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:45,254
Mr Sergeyev was not notified
of the upcoming seizure a year in advance

191
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:48,087
due to which he incurred expenses
related to improving his property.

192
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:52,119
Also, the purchase price did not consider
his loss of business revenue

193
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:57,585
as well as his liabilities
to third parties.

194
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,784
The Court ruled: by Decree No. 1295
pf Pribrezhny Town Administration,

195
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:06,649
the land parcel shall be seized
to build a town communications centre.

196
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:11,015
The Decree determines the purchase
price of the land and structures

197
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:13,781
as 639,540.27 roubles.

198
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,481
The purchase price was determined
based on an evaluation.

199
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:20,780
Per Mr Sergeyev's request,
Alliance Ltd estimated the value

200
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,746
of liabilities
for the loss of agricultural production

201
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:28,678
due to the seizure of the land parcel
of 0.66 acres for the town's needs.

202
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:33,410
The market value of the liabilities
constitutes 3.5 million roubles.

203
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:34,610
The court questions...

204
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:49,706
...and deems it invalid.

205
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:53,439
The Court upholds the purchase price
of 639,540.27 roubles

206
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:56,772
as determined
by the Town Administration's evaluation.

207
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:01,804
The Court rejects the statement that
the purchase procedure was violated.

208
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:04,870
The case file contains letters

209
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:09,702
about the purchase and testimony
of Town Administration officials

210
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,969
stating that Mr Sergeyev

211
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,868
had been notified
of the seizure of the land parcel.

212
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:19,100
The Court casts doubt
on Mr Sergeyev's claims

213
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,967
that he didn't receive
these notifications.

214
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:27,598
Having examined Mr Sergeyev's appeal,
Pribrezhny Town Court has concluded

215
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:32,131
that Mr Sergeyev failed to establish
grounds to repeal the court ruling

216
00:21:32,264 --> 00:21:36,030
pursuant to article 330
of the Civil Procedural Code.

217
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:42,129
As per articles 320-335 of the Civil
Procedural Code, the court denies

218
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:46,661
Mr Sergeyev's petition to revoke
the ruling of the Zagorye District Court.

219
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:51,327
That ruling is upheld,
and Mr Sergeyev's appeal is denied.

220
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,693
The ruling
shall come into effect forthwith.

221
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,189
Well, shall we go?

222
00:22:09,156 --> 00:22:10,423
In a minute.

223
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:13,742
Vadim, every time you come,

224
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,175
all you do
is worry about the election.

225
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:18,308
It's not for another year.

226
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:21,074
In fair weather, prepare for foul.

227
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:26,006
You do well to tend

228
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:27,839
to worldly matters,

229
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:30,339
but remember the divine.

230
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,771
But I...

231
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:34,304
Don't I already?

232
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:35,870
I know.

233
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:39,270
You're a most...

234
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:41,769
charitable patron.

235
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:46,202
Even today, you come from afar,
bearing gifts.

236
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,267
Have some fish.

237
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,534
Right.

238
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,933
I'm telling you,

239
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,132
don't worry so much.

240
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,598
All power comes from God.

241
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:06,064
As long as God wishes for it,
you need not worry.

242
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:09,197
And does He?

243
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,595
Who can I ask if not you?
You're the priest!

244
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:18,861
He does.

245
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,494
Chase it with some food.

246
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:42,723
Hello.

247
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:46,689
Yes. Thank God, finally.

248
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:52,288
Get Tyagunov's guys on it.

249
00:24:54,253 --> 00:24:56,087
Why wait?

250
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,952
Tear down that bastard's
fucking place already!

251
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,651
We've lost so much time
because of him.

252
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:09,050
How's that your fault?
Drop the excuses!

253
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,217
OK, later.

254
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:16,116
Lyosha, get my thing...

255
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,915
from the glove compartment.

256
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:43,077
Hey, Vasya.

257
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:47,042
Let's pay that fucking arsehole...

258
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:49,442
a visit real quick.

259
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,908
The one at the bottom of the hill.

260
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,174
- Past the bridge?
- Yes.

261
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:57,040
There are lots of arseholes
at the bottom of hills.

262
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,139
What?

263
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:03,506
You trying to be smart now?

264
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:07,905
It's obvious that the prick
wants this place

265
00:26:08,038 --> 00:26:10,304
so he can build himself a palace!

266
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:12,137
Calm down. That's enough.

267
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,870
I built this place with my own hands!

268
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:24,234
Here we go again.

269
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:26,767
Kolya...

270
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,029
Here.

271
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:52,595
My whole life is here.

272
00:26:54,161 --> 00:26:56,894
My grandfather lived here.
And my father...

273
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:58,594
He's seen it before.

274
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:00,526
Stay out of this!

275
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:01,793
Stop yelling!

276
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:03,493
Kolya, calm down.

277
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,089
Come on, Dima.

278
00:27:21,455 --> 00:27:22,821
Let's have a drink.

279
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,186
Here's to you.

280
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:37,918
All right.

281
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:50,083
- To everything you've done for us.
- If you say so, bro.

282
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:53,782
Thank you.

283
00:27:55,948 --> 00:27:57,448
Thank you.

284
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:00,647
What are you talking about?
It'll be fine.

285
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:02,313
But that dirt of yours...

286
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,646
Kolya, that's not my fucking dirt.
It's his.

287
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:09,778
All I'm saying is,

288
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:12,044
I don't see a way

289
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:16,243
to put your theory to work.

290
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:21,509
Either way,
they're knocking this place down.

291
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:29,574
We'll buy that crappy apartment
near Angela's

292
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,274
with that 639,000 roubles
and 27 kopecks

293
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:36,239
and I'll become a cop, like Pasha.

294
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:37,472
Oh no...

295
00:28:39,838 --> 00:28:41,238
Listen, bro,

296
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:45,371
this is not like you.

297
00:28:46,337 --> 00:28:47,870
You hear me?

298
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:53,635
You've never let problems
get to you before.

299
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:56,068
What's the matter with you?

300
00:28:57,934 --> 00:29:02,967
Things were different.
We're not 20 anymore.

301
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:05,566
The years take their toll.

302
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:07,466
Anyway, what are you on about?

303
00:29:09,332 --> 00:29:11,098
Are you a shrink now?

304
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:14,331
I'm no fucking shrink.

305
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:16,630
But fuck, man, it's like...

306
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:21,363
You can look
at this situation differently.

307
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,695
How is that?

308
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:24,995
Fucking hell...

309
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:26,395
You're my brother!

310
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,694
Take on the challenge,
for fuck's sake!

311
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,794
It's a fresh start!

312
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,426
Easy for you to say.
You're off to Moscow tomorrow...

313
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,025
What's Moscow got to do with it?
Come with me then. You hear me?

314
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,525
Why not?

315
00:29:42,658 --> 00:29:44,224
- To Moscow?
- Sure.

316
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,624
Pack your bags.

317
00:29:47,857 --> 00:29:51,389
Rent a studio apartment
for starters, for about 30,000.

318
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:52,956
Oh, wow!

319
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,856
What? That's a fair price.

320
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:59,955
A fucking genius handyman like you
won't have any problems finding work!

321
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:02,820
With your hands, you'll be all right.

322
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:05,586
We'll find something for Lilya, too.

323
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,153
Maybe in some shop at first.

324
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:13,752
Anything is better than cleaning fish
at that stinking fish farm.

325
00:30:14,418 --> 00:30:16,917
What's the matter with you, bro?

326
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:24,316
What about Roma?

327
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:27,082
What about him? He'll go to school.

328
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:29,181
He's a kid. He goes to school!

329
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:31,014
Sort of...

330
00:30:32,114 --> 00:30:34,647
He's barely a C-student.
Who will take him?

331
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:37,979
They're required to.
They'll take him.

332
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,646
Kolya!

333
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:42,645
I'm not a C-student. I get Bs.

334
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:44,078
Don't get worked up.

335
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:46,645
What are you doing listening to us?

336
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:49,510
Why would I do that?
I just went to the toilet.

337
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:51,044
Come over here then!

338
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:53,676
Come on.

339
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:04,907
What's up guys? You need help?

340
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,873
Kolya, don't you recognise authority

341
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:10,772
when you see it?

342
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,738
And what do you want, "Authority"?

343
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:17,338
Just all of this.

344
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:20,704
Come and get it.

345
00:31:21,203 --> 00:31:23,037
Will it all fit

346
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:24,936
into your hearse?

347
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:27,702
What else?

348
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:33,035
You're all insects.

349
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,766
You always have to make things
difficult, don't you?

350
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,765
That's way you're all drowning in shit.

351
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,932
Kolya,

352
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,964
have you packed your suitcases?

353
00:31:47,098 --> 00:31:50,997
Look, sir, it's you
who's not supposed to be here now.

354
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,096
The court ruling
hasn't taken effect yet.

355
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:58,995
And your office doesn't entitle you
to come here. Do you have a warrant?

356
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:01,328
Who are you?

357
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:02,761
Dmitri Seleznev,

358
00:32:03,361 --> 00:32:06,494
Moscow Bar Association.

359
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,593
Kolya's lawyer in litigation
with your gang.

360
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:15,892
Oh, yeah, I heard someone
babbling about that.

361
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:20,624
So what's up, Kolya?
Can't stand up for yourself anymore?

362
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:22,990
Ignore him, man.
Take it easy, Kolya.

363
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,156
I'll stand up to you, bitch.

364
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:31,888
Please, no more, I just shit myself.

365
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,954
Scary stuff.

366
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,287
- Sir...
- OK.

367
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:41,820
Maybe I just wanted to have
a friendly drink with you.

368
00:32:43,186 --> 00:32:45,585
By the way, where is it?
Give it here.

369
00:32:46,585 --> 00:32:47,885
Want some?

370
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:49,684
No?

371
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:51,418
Guess not.

372
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,517
I'm not gonna offer him any.
I don't like his kind.

373
00:32:56,749 --> 00:33:00,982
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
something to bear in mind.

374
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:03,081
Lilya, call the police.

375
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,281
Go ahead, Lilya, call them!

376
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:08,580
The police. Do it.

377
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,980
What's your name, kid?

378
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:15,312
Listen, Vadim,
why are you doing this?

379
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:17,845
You're not so drunk
that you don't know...

380
00:33:17,978 --> 00:33:21,311
Shut your mouth, you courtroom rat.

381
00:33:21,444 --> 00:33:24,243
And you, listen up.

382
00:33:24,343 --> 00:33:26,610
- Fuck off.
- Remember my face!

383
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:28,242
Ignore him, bro.

384
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,109
You piece of shit.

385
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,075
You've never had any fucking rights

386
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:38,440
and never will!

387
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,907
Where the fuck are you going?

388
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:44,939
Listen, it would be best
if you go now.

389
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:49,705
You are trespassing.

390
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:52,437
And the owners are not happy
to see you.

391
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:55,237
Vadim, let's not escalate the situation.

392
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:57,036
What did you just say?

393
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,736
I'm the owner.

394
00:34:00,335 --> 00:34:03,335
- Got it?
- Got it. I've got it.

395
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:05,901
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

396
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:07,634
Tomorrow.

397
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:10,167
We have some business to discuss.

398
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:13,400
Ivan has told me a lot about you.

399
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:20,931
Ivan who?

400
00:34:21,065 --> 00:34:22,731
Ivan Kostrov.

401
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,064
From the Committee. Kostrov.

402
00:34:27,663 --> 00:34:31,262
Just because we can't see them,
doesn't mean they're not there.

403
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:37,028
Anyway, I'm tired of you all...

404
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,727
So what about tomorrow?

405
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:41,894
Tomorrow.

406
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:47,059
Between 3 and 5pm.

407
00:34:48,392 --> 00:34:51,324
Office hours for constituent issues.

408
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,257
I'm all right. I'm all right.

409
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:13,987
Kolya, are you going out hunting
or something?

410
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:17,552
Give me that.

411
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:20,585
Bro,

412
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:25,784
tomorrow we'll write a statement
about his abuse of office.

413
00:35:25,884 --> 00:35:27,984
We'll tear him to bits, Kolya!

414
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,216
Dima...

415
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:33,449
I won't go to Moscow.

416
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,115
I'm staying here.

417
00:35:38,714 --> 00:35:40,048
Let's drink.

418
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:50,012
"The actions of Vadim Shelevyat
caused great harm to my family.

419
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:54,411
"He was not authorised to implement
a ruling yet to come into effect

420
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:57,577
"and he committed a criminal act

421
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,243
"as defined by Article 330
of the Criminal Code.

422
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:04,742

of the Criminal Code

423
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:07,108

of the Criminal Procedural Code,

424

425
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:13,940
"and, pending evidence,
a criminal case to be opened."

426
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,040
Take that, arsehole.

427
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,568
Here's another one, Kolya.

428
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,935
What?

429
00:36:40,035 --> 00:36:41,234
Look.

430
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:46,200
"Darwin's term for directional
and irreversible historical

431
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,733
"development of life."

432
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:51,566
9 letters.

433
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:55,831
A prolonged leap
from the twat to the grave.

434
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:59,197
What's with the swearing,
Sergeant Potty Mouth?

435
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,296
- Takes one to know one.
- Sure does.

436
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:08,062
"E-vo-lu-tion."

437
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:09,928
It fits.

438
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:14,361
Good morning.

439
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:18,160
Are you almost done?

440
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:19,560
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:37:20,192 --> 00:37:21,826
Another half hour or so.

442
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:25,825
I've written it.
Just sign it, and we'll be off.

443
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,558
Dima!

444
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,156
I'm not sure if Kolya told you,
but I just had a birthday.

445
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,289
Happy birthday.

446
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:39,222
So I invite you to join us tomorrow.

447
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:41,788
Campfire, kebabs, vodka,
a bit of shooting...

448
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:43,554
My treat.

449
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:45,554
Shooting - as in, hunting?

450
00:37:45,687 --> 00:37:47,320
Of course not.

451
00:37:47,986 --> 00:37:49,753
We're going with women and kids.

452
00:37:50,419 --> 00:37:53,952
We'll just do
a little target practice, for fun.

453
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:55,852
Is it far?

454
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:57,518
Hundred kilometers or so.

455
00:37:57,618 --> 00:38:00,084
We'll leave early, hit the booze,

456
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:02,817
shoot a little and come back.

457
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,882
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

458
00:38:07,216 --> 00:38:08,549
Kolya, I'm ready when you are.

459
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,914
Pardon me?

460
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:18,080
Are you the victim?

461
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,379
No, Mr Sergeyev is the victim.
I'm his lawyer.

462
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:36,076
Off he goes.

463
00:38:36,743 --> 00:38:38,775
Reporting to his superiors.

464
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,906
Lilya, got any water?

465
00:38:57,738 --> 00:39:00,071
I have a feeling he won't accept it.

466
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:03,137
- Can he do that?
- Sure.

467
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,437
Even though he has to by law.

468
00:39:05,537 --> 00:39:07,269
So what then?

469
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:10,436
We go to the prosecutor's office,
And then court.

470
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:13,001
If necessary, we'll file a complaint
about this guy too.

471
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,101
We'll need all the facts,
even the minor ones.

472
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:17,567
Are you going to fight
the whole town?

473
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:21,233
These animals are not
the whole town.

474
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,899
Kolya, you know what I mean.

475
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,799
Where did our lieutenant go?

476
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,232
Just wait.

477
00:39:33,097 --> 00:39:35,230
Hey there, lieutenant!
Where are you?

478
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,163
Sir, calm down!

479
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:38,762
What's this racket?

480
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:40,229
Everything's OK.

481
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:42,829
- I'm not talking to you.
- Will it be long?

482
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:44,995
What's this behaviour?

483
00:39:45,095 --> 00:39:47,161
Why are you making trouble?

484
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,427
Detain this one.

485
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,493
Put him in custody!
Take him to a cell.

486
00:39:59,558 --> 00:40:03,324
The prosecutor is not here,
and I'm not authorised.

487
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:04,857
I can't accept your statement.

488
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:08,123
And there's not a soul
in the entire office besides you?

489
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:10,189
No one who is authorised.

490
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,755
Did they all get drafted?
You don't think it's strange?

491
00:40:12,889 --> 00:40:13,922
No.

492
00:40:14,022 --> 00:40:15,522
We only have two of them.

493
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:19,387
The public prosecutor is off sick,
and the detective is out on a case.

494
00:40:19,487 --> 00:40:22,053
You can mail it in. Or go to court.

495
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:24,020
OK, I get it.
Give me a refusal note in writing.

496
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:28,585
I told you: I'm not authorised.

497
00:40:30,418 --> 00:40:32,251
Hello. I need to see the judge.

498
00:40:32,384 --> 00:40:33,918
No one's here.

499
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,817
- No one at all?
- No one.

500
00:40:36,883 --> 00:40:38,883
No assistants or secretaries?

501
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:43,382
- When will they be in?
- I've not been informed.

502
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,548
- I see.
- Goodbye.

503
00:40:45,648 --> 00:40:46,815
Thanks.

504
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:04,177
- Up the stairs, third floor.
- Thanks.

505
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,229
Why aren't you answering your phone?
I called and called.

506
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,762
Seriously?
That little devil Vitya

507
00:42:13,862 --> 00:42:15,796
must have been playing with it.

508
00:42:16,228 --> 00:42:17,628
Surrender!

509
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:20,027
- Why try to kill me?
- 'Cause you're pretty!

510
00:42:20,127 --> 00:42:22,894
- Say hello to Lilya!
- Howdy!

511
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:27,359
Men are all the same.
First, you're pretty. Next, they'll kill you.

512
00:42:27,493 --> 00:42:29,593
Angela, where's Pasha?

513
00:42:49,855 --> 00:42:51,321
I've already heard

514
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:54,087
of your crusades earlier today.

515
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,620
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

516
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,819
- What's your name, I forget?
- Dmitry.

517
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:05,685
Right. So, you're really trying
to stick it to me, aren't you?

518
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:07,684
You asked for it.

519
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:10,750
But that's nothing, Vadim,

520
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,350
in comparison
to what's in this folder.

521
00:43:13,483 --> 00:43:15,515
Here, take a look.

522
00:43:17,415 --> 00:43:18,948
There's nothing
you don't already know,

523
00:43:19,048 --> 00:43:23,314
but it's good to refresh
your memory sometimes.

524
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:26,280
This conversation is off
to a strange start.

525
00:43:26,447 --> 00:43:27,713
How so?

526
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:30,679
I thought we were going to talk
about your friend.

527
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:33,645
As in, about our litigation
or something else?

528
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:34,878
Something else.

529
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:37,144
You must mean his unlawful detention?

530
00:43:37,244 --> 00:43:40,844
Article 301
of the Russian Criminal Code.

531
00:43:42,143 --> 00:43:43,977
It's good you've been notified.

532
00:43:44,576 --> 00:43:48,476
Vadim, it would be great
if you saw to it that justice is served

533
00:43:48,608 --> 00:43:50,775
and those responsible
for this outrage are punished.

534
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,275
I would be glad to help, but...

535
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:56,507
But you don't see what's in it for you?
Just look in the folder.

536
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,940
Take a look.

537
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,173
You'll see that Kolya's release
is only the first step.

538
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:03,905
Here's what I think we'll do,

539
00:44:05,238 --> 00:44:07,971
young man.

540
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:14,903
I'll let your Kolya out,
and you'll gather your stuff

541
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,169
and quietly go back

542
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:20,401
to where you came from.

543
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:23,201
- To Moscow?
- Yeah, back to Moscow.

544
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:26,900
Vadim, I'm afraid
Ivan would not have that.

545
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:31,699
He'd say,
"Dima, why didn't you do

546
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:34,632
"everything in your power
to restore justice?"

547
00:44:38,198 --> 00:44:41,464
You know Ivan personally?

548
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:42,597
Ivan Kostrov?

549
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,996
We're talking about him, right?

550
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,029
Of course I do. You bet.

551
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,162
We're pals.

552
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:50,895
He's a lawyer, I'm a lawyer.

553
00:44:51,562 --> 00:44:53,594
Moscow is a huge,
but close-knit city.

554
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:57,461
No one is out of reach.

555
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,560
And if I don't read this, then what?

556
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:02,192
Doesn't matter.

557
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:04,825
Take my word for it:
the facts in there are damning.

558
00:45:04,925 --> 00:45:08,558
You know what I'm talking about.
They are, after all, your handiwork.

559
00:45:08,658 --> 00:45:10,191
Horrible stuff.

560
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:13,590
How do you sleep at night?

561
00:45:14,823 --> 00:45:16,023
So,

562
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,622
let's make a deal, or else...

563
00:45:18,722 --> 00:45:20,122
Or else what?

564
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,155
Oh, it's hard to even imagine
what would happen.

565
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,487
All within the provisions of the law,
of course.

566
00:45:27,587 --> 00:45:31,153
Firstly, your name would be all over
the newspapers and the Internet

567
00:45:31,253 --> 00:45:34,319
and on TV, all over the news.

568
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:45,783
You youngsters
like playing with fire.

569
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:49,249
Vadim,
you're not exactly an old man either.

570
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,549
Or is it time to retire? No?

571
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:52,981
Have you thought of that?

572
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:58,580
Come back with the tea later, Yulia.

573
00:46:03,313 --> 00:46:06,412
Right. Let's see it.

574
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:11,411
Let's see what you're trying
to stick us with here.

575
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:14,610
A horror movie with you in the lead.

576
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:19,109
How did it go? They cuffed him
and threw him in the cage.

577
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:21,542
What did he do? Nothing!

578
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:25,674
Last night, the mayor barreled in,
drunk, told 'em to pack their things.

579
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:27,541
They had
another court hearing yesterday.

580
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:29,207
Yes, they're getting demolished.

581
00:46:29,973 --> 00:46:31,307
That's all.

582
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,406
This morning, they went to the police
to drop off a statement

583
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:37,239
and they took Kolya in.

584
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:41,938
Lilya is sitting right here with me.

585
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:45,970
Don't be dumb,
I'm not calling just for a chat.

586
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,436
Tell Stepanych to get his arse
to the police department.

587
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:51,536
We have to get Kolya out of there.

588
00:46:53,002 --> 00:46:54,168
Good.

589
00:46:54,635 --> 00:46:56,335
Yeah, you'd better go yourself.

590
00:46:57,967 --> 00:47:00,900
And call us right away.
We're stressing out here.

591
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,233
And pick up when I call,
or I'll worry. OK then.

592
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,333
What?

593
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:08,099
Me too.

594
00:47:09,365 --> 00:47:11,564
OK, Pasha, go already. Bye.

595
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,231
- Something like that.
- Thanks.

596
00:47:15,331 --> 00:47:17,530
Don't worry, they'll get him out.

597
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:21,330
They got Vova out 5 times.
He was in for real stuff - fighting,

598
00:47:21,462 --> 00:47:23,196
theft...

599
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,162
Mum, I'm hungry.

600
00:47:25,295 --> 00:47:26,895
Go play outside.
Dinner's not ready yet.

601
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:29,094
- Can I?
- What?

602
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:31,160
- Go outside?
- I just told you, go!

603
00:47:31,294 --> 00:47:34,759
But not too far. If you go
to building 9 again, I'll kill you!

604
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:36,459
- OK, Mum!
- And put your hat on!

605
00:47:44,691 --> 00:47:45,924
Come on in.

606
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:58,088
It's OK, honey. We'll pull through.

607
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:02,387
We'll get all hands on deck
and do a great job.

608
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,720
Won't be fancy, but it'll be homely.

609
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:08,852
Won't it?

610
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:15,751
Let's go look at the kitchen.

611
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,549
There's even a radiator in here.

612
00:48:23,449 --> 00:48:24,516
You hear me?

613
00:48:30,515 --> 00:48:32,447
Let's say you got me. Now what?

614
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,114
That depends on you.

615
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:36,713
I got that much. What do you want?

616
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:43,745
You're the second public official today
to use that tone with me.

617
00:48:43,845 --> 00:48:46,977
Don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.

618
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:50,943
I want Kolya to keep what's his.

619
00:48:55,442 --> 00:48:57,042
That's not possible.

620
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:02,241
I thought there was
nothing impossible for you.

621
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,707
Well, now you know better.

622
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:08,473
You can't get 3.5 million?
I don't believe that.

623
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:10,639
Oh, that's what you mean.

624
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:13,272
That I can do.

625
00:49:13,372 --> 00:49:15,471
And, of course, release Kolya.

626
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:17,005
It's a deal.

627
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:20,070
Leave me your phone number.

628
00:49:20,704 --> 00:49:23,936
I'll call you in a couple of days.
We'll meet and discuss the details.

629
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:25,635
You'll still be here?

630
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:26,969
Yes, I'll be in town.

631
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:29,202
Except what's there to discuss?

632
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:33,667
We'll only need to meet
so you can hand me the money.

633
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:40,366
Hey, are you baptised?

634
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:41,499
What?

635
00:49:42,632 --> 00:49:44,299
Why da you ask?

636
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:46,431
I'm just curious.

637
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,297
I'm a lawyer, Vadim.
I believe in facts.

638
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:57,129
OK. You got it.

639
00:49:57,129 --> 00:49:58,296
Goodbye.

640
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,661
Bye.

641
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,087
Is everything OK, Vadim?

642
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:39,686
Yes.

643
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:42,319
You never brought me that aspirin.

644
00:50:44,452 --> 00:50:47,051
Get me those three right away.

645
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:49,384
Who?

646
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:52,116
Tarasov, Goryunov and Tkachuk.

647
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,083
Find them, I don't care how.

648
00:50:58,715 --> 00:51:00,215
And close the door.

649
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,314
You think
he'll give us the 3 million?

650
00:51:02,448 --> 00:51:04,514
Not 3, but 3.5.

651
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:05,947
We'll see.

652
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:09,413
But he shit himself big time.
And that's a good sign.

653
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,312
Right...

654
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,611
What did I have here last time?

655
00:51:16,745 --> 00:51:18,678
Borscht, dumplings, beer.

656
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:20,210
That's it.

657
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:21,510
Have you decided?

658
00:51:21,577 --> 00:51:24,677
Yes, Tatyana.
Bring us two borschts, please,

659
00:51:25,143 --> 00:51:28,509
two servings of dumplings,
beer and fruit juice.

660
00:51:28,642 --> 00:51:30,208
Or are you having beer too?

661
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:31,842
Fruit juice is fine.

662
00:51:31,975 --> 00:51:33,175
- Fruit juice then.
- Is that it?

663
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:34,375
Yes, that's all.

664
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:37,107
I have to go up to my room.

665
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:39,673
Please wait 10 minutes
so the food doesn't get cold.

666
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:42,473
- All right.
- Thanks.

667
00:51:44,872 --> 00:51:47,105
Can you wait a bit?
I'll be right back.

668
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:00,822
Kolya?

669
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:02,288
<i>Hello, where are you?</i>

670
00:53:02,422 --> 00:53:05,455
We're in the restaurant at the hotel.

671
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:06,621
Well, of course.

672
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:10,954
I'm behind bars - you're at a restaurant.
I should have known.

673
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:13,986
Yes, they released me.

674
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:21,218
Not on the phone.
Let's meet, and you'll tell me everything.

675
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:23,017
Finish up.

676
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:26,150
I'm headed there. See you.

677
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:01,443
They've been keeping dirt on me!

678
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:03,775
I've known it a long time.

679
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:07,574
All I ever hear from you is
the same thing right, left and centre:

680
00:54:07,674 --> 00:54:11,441
"Everything's fine, Vadim".

681
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,473
"Everything's fine, perfect weather -

682
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:16,872
"nothing to worry about!"

683
00:54:17,006 --> 00:54:19,572
But I'm fucking worried!

684
00:54:20,771 --> 00:54:24,838
Because I smell a rat.
Something bad is brewing!

685
00:54:25,004 --> 00:54:28,170
When did anything like this
ever happen? I crush some louse

686
00:54:28,303 --> 00:54:33,169
and he turns the tables on me!
Brings in a lawyer from Moscow!

687
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:35,935
And that bastard starts
blackmailing me.

688
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:38,068
And drops big names!

689
00:54:38,168 --> 00:54:39,934
What if he's bluffing?

690
00:54:40,034 --> 00:54:41,201
Bluffing?

691
00:54:41,301 --> 00:54:45,300
How about you stop doodling
and figure out who's paying him?

692
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:47,033
You think it's that loser Kolya?

693
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:49,365
You should know better, woman.

694
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:54,364
Or do you think
that Moscow lawyer came here

695
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:56,197
to bust his arse for free?

696
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:57,597
More importantly,

697
00:54:57,731 --> 00:55:00,963
where did he get that information?

698
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,762
I almost fucking lost it
when I opened that folder.

699
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:08,395
So what was in that folder?

700
00:55:08,495 --> 00:55:11,428
You don't need to know that.

701
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:18,826
So they have something on you
that we don't know about?

702
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:21,258
We have an election in a year.

703
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:22,592
Did you forget?

704
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,991
If I don't get elected...

705
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,457
Need I say more?

706
00:55:31,323 --> 00:55:33,556
You'll all go down.

707
00:55:34,189 --> 00:55:36,489
No holidays abroad, no mansions,

708
00:55:37,222 --> 00:55:38,255
no cash.

709
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:41,588
We'll all be marching

710
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:43,753
off to the monastery

711
00:55:43,853 --> 00:55:45,853
to a jolly tune.

712
00:55:45,953 --> 00:55:47,820
You're paranoid.

713
00:55:47,953 --> 00:55:50,886
You see enemies everywhere.
Ease up on the booze.

714
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:55,118
Your head will roll first!

715
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:58,750
Cut the drama.
And don't yell at me!

716
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,883
Save that for your wife.

717
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,516
Let's be constructive.

718
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:04,882
Let's.

719
00:56:06,416 --> 00:56:08,915
Maybe I could lean on him a bit?

720
00:56:09,548 --> 00:56:12,247
Within lawful limits, of course.

721
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:13,947
Absolutely not.

722
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:20,745
First off, get me the story
on this Moscow lawyer.

723
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,678
Use your own channels or work together,
but find out who he is

724
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:30,877
and who he's working for.

725
00:56:31,643 --> 00:56:34,742
He was rubbing it in
about Kostrov,

726
00:56:34,876 --> 00:56:36,609
and you say "lean on him"?

727
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:38,409
The Committee Chairman?

728
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:43,808
That's right, sweetheart. Why do you
think I've been going on about it?

729
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:48,739
So get to it.

730
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,439
Tomorrow, I'll consult the bosses.

731
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:56,238
They're going
to run their checks on him.

732
00:56:57,271 --> 00:57:00,470
Get to it, my good people,
and get cracking.

733
00:57:22,366 --> 00:57:23,366
Hello, Dad...

734
00:57:23,832 --> 00:57:25,332
But it's still early.

735
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:29,898
Oh, I forgot...
Yeah, I'll be right there... Sure, OK.

736
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:32,264
Yeah, I'm not far.

737
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:35,163
OK, guys, I'm off.

738
00:57:36,263 --> 00:57:39,828
- Mummy calling you?
- We're going out shooting tomorrow.

739
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:41,562
You're lucky!

740
00:57:42,428 --> 00:57:45,461
That's right,
go and watch your bedtime cartoons.

741
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:16,820
Where is everyone?

742
00:58:17,354 --> 00:58:19,153
Mum is asleep.

743
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:22,553
Dima's in the outhouse
with a magazine.

744
00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:29,451
So, mate,

745
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:33,217
you like Dima?

746
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,783
Sure. Seems like an all right guy.

747
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:41,682
That "all right guy"
did a major deed today.

748
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:43,582
What deed?

749
00:58:44,214 --> 00:58:45,648
He squeezed the mayor.

750
00:58:47,181 --> 00:58:48,247
What?

751
00:58:48,913 --> 00:58:50,780
Just like that, son.

752
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,613
Took him by the balls

753
00:58:53,346 --> 00:58:55,946
and pulled ever so gently.

754
00:58:58,978 --> 00:59:00,345
I don't get it.

755
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:03,444
You'll get it when you're older.

756
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:04,710
Listen,

757
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:07,110
you stink of fire.

758
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,376
Hanging out
in the old church again?

759
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:10,509
Well, yeah.

760
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:12,775
Always looking for trouble.

761
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:17,307
- What kind of trouble?
- Some kind or other.

762
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:21,274
Stuffing your face right before bed?

763
00:59:22,706 --> 00:59:23,706
Well, yeah.

764
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:31,371
Come over here.

765
00:59:32,104 --> 00:59:33,137
Sit down.

766
00:59:34,903 --> 00:59:36,203
What is it?

767
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:40,536
Were you drinking beer?

768
00:59:42,202 --> 00:59:44,635
No. The other guys had some.

769
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:46,501
I can smell it on you.

770
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:47,701
Hey, Roma.

771
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,400
What took you so long?

772
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:54,333
Lay a cable out there?

773
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:57,399
Interesting book
you've got out there.

774
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,831
Couldn't put it down?

775
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:03,897
Yeah...

776
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:08,996
A couple of comedians, eh?

777
01:00:10,096 --> 01:00:14,662
Yeah, that's our shitty
northern sense of humour.

778
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:22,260
What's so funny?

779
01:00:22,393 --> 01:00:25,626
It's all good, bro.

780
01:00:26,959 --> 01:00:28,692
It's all good.

781
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,991
No, seriously, what am I missing?

782
01:00:33,025 --> 01:00:34,658
Whatever, you idiots...

783
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,725
Can you do this?

784
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:08,091
I'll show you. Watch.

785
01:03:11,024 --> 01:03:13,090
Pasha, turn off that crap.

786
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:16,856
Dima!

787
01:03:17,355 --> 01:03:18,889
Come here for a moment.

788
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,221
Pasha, what the hell?

789
01:03:24,321 --> 01:03:27,087
Angela, let's enjoy the silence.

790
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:29,320
Not enough silence at your place?

791
01:03:31,052 --> 01:03:32,119
Dima,

792
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:35,419
- I'm trusting you with my rifle.
- Thanks.

793
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:38,085
Every guy should have his own gun,

794
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:40,118
so you don't have to share Kolya's.

795
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,484
Agreed.

796
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:44,017
What will you use then?

797
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:45,683
I'll show you.

798
01:03:45,816 --> 01:03:46,983
You need help, Kolya?

799
01:03:47,116 --> 01:03:50,182
No, Dima, I've got this.
Relax, kick back.

800
01:03:50,315 --> 01:03:51,482
You're the guest.

801
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:55,347
Wow, Stepanych!

802
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:56,914
Someone's armed for war.

803
01:03:57,047 --> 01:04:00,046
Why not? I like shooting in style.
It's my birthday.

804
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:04,179
- What, no grenade launcher?
- Show me the target, I'll get one.

805
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:09,978
- Mum, I'm thirsty.
- It's in the car.

806
01:04:13,277 --> 01:04:16,043
Where are you going?
Out of the water, now!

807
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:19,209
Vitya, are you deaf?
I said, get out of the water!

808
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,841
So, Kolya,

809
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:26,308
shall we?

810
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,607
Sure.

811
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,339
Dima,

812
01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:35,206
Pasha, come on!

813
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:18,229
Dima,

814
01:05:19,163 --> 01:05:22,362
one drink if you hit it,
three if you miss.

815
01:05:22,496 --> 01:05:23,962
Got it.

816
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,727
One drink!

817
01:05:34,126 --> 01:05:35,393
Just one!

818
01:05:35,493 --> 01:05:37,892
To your health, Stepanych!
Cheers!

819
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:39,325
Same to you.

820
01:05:40,692 --> 01:05:43,058
Go, Pasha. Nail it.

821
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:44,791
Don't jinx me.

822
01:05:53,322 --> 01:05:54,355
Three drinks for him.

823
01:05:54,455 --> 01:05:57,154
He missed on purpose,
to get shitfaced.

824
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,688
- Just pour it.
- Have a pickle.

825
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:01,320
To you, Comrade Colonel.

826
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,619
Dima, you show them.

827
01:06:09,818 --> 01:06:11,951
Anyone can hit it with a sight.

828
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:14,451
The sight was closed.

829
01:06:14,551 --> 01:06:16,350
Are you for me or against me?

830
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,150
Stepanych.

831
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:21,949
Pleasure to meet you,
happy birthday!

832
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:23,315
Pleasure's all mine.

833
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:29,914
Stepanych, just don't...

834
01:06:33,913 --> 01:06:35,313
Enjoying the silence?

835
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:37,079
What did you do that for?

836
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:39,412
What do we use for a target now?

837
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:42,345
Your hat? Are you fucking crazy?

838
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:43,744
Kolya,  the kids...

839
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:46,810
What about the kids?
They just went deaf.

840
01:06:46,944 --> 01:06:48,143
No, I heard everything.

841
01:06:48,277 --> 01:06:51,743
Can't I shoot to my heart's content
on my birthday?

842
01:06:51,843 --> 01:06:52,876
Well, now you have.

843
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:56,042
I've got better targets still.

844
01:06:57,775 --> 01:06:59,041
Pasha!

845
01:06:59,175 --> 01:07:00,307
Go get them.

846
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:02,940
Angela, shall we get started
on the kebabs?

847
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:08,039
- Can I shoot the AK, please?
- Ask Stepanych.

848
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:10,739
Stepanych, can I fire your AK?

849
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:12,105
Sure.

850
01:07:12,572 --> 01:07:15,171
He's a grown boy. Let him.

851
01:07:15,304 --> 01:07:17,603
Stay with us, gals.
It's about to get interesting.

852
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:19,837
Call us when it does.

853
01:07:21,436 --> 01:07:24,269
- I'll go and light the grill.
- Can you manage?

854
01:07:25,102 --> 01:07:26,135
I think so...

855
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,767
Nice one, Stepanych!

856
01:07:39,132 --> 01:07:41,232
Got anyone more current?

857
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:43,998
I've got all kinds of stuff.

858
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:46,797
But it's too early
for the current ones.

859
01:07:46,864 --> 01:07:49,230
Not enough
of a historical perspective.

860
01:07:49,364 --> 01:07:51,730
Let them ripen up on the wall a bit.

861
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:53,963
How do we stand them up?

862
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:56,395
Nail them to the log.

863
01:07:57,062 --> 01:07:58,328
Do we have nails?

864
01:07:58,862 --> 01:07:59,928
No.

865
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:02,294
I've got some screws in the car.

866
01:08:09,226 --> 01:08:10,759
Let's go have a drink.

867
01:08:10,892 --> 01:08:12,125
Let's.

868
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,924
I've got Yeltsin, too.

869
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:24,389
But he's more small-time.

870
01:08:25,489 --> 01:08:26,956
The drunken conductor...

871
01:08:28,288 --> 01:08:30,621
We forgot the nails...
Your fault.

872
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:33,554
Look at you, girls!
There's a sight for sore eyes!

873
01:08:33,687 --> 01:08:36,087
Look at those honed,
precise movements!

874
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,586
Yeah.

875
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,486
We're quite the roadside attraction!

876
01:08:48,284 --> 01:08:50,751
- Any bread?
- In the bag.

877
01:08:50,851 --> 01:08:54,350
- What else is there?
- Pickles.

878
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,216
- Help me.
- I'm busy.

879
01:08:56,316 --> 01:08:59,115
- I'm busy too.
- What are you busy with?

880
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:00,448
With stuff...

881
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:06,580
Kolya, come here! Let's drink.

882
01:09:16,078 --> 01:09:17,378
That's enough.

883
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:21,177
My oh my, what a guy...

884
01:09:23,943 --> 01:09:25,509
Where are you off to, Lilya?

885
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:28,075
Wouldn't you like to know?

886
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,275
Did we bring the charcoal?

887
01:09:30,408 --> 01:09:32,708
- What for?
- We'll run out of wood.

888
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:36,407
Plenty of driftwood.
Go get some, but have a drink first.

889
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:38,040
Chase it down.

890
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,039
Where's my drink?

891
01:09:42,139 --> 01:09:43,306
Here you are.

892
01:09:44,705 --> 01:09:46,071
Thank you.

893
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:51,470
Oh, this is nice!

894
01:09:53,203 --> 01:09:56,603
- Where is that wood, you say?
- Past the waterfall. You'll see it.

895
01:09:56,736 --> 01:09:57,902
Got it.

896
01:10:10,266 --> 01:10:12,633
Vitya, come down here.

897
01:10:12,733 --> 01:10:13,799
I'm scared.

898
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:15,532
- Give me your hand.
- No, I'm scared.

899
01:10:17,265 --> 01:10:19,098
Suit yourself.

900
01:10:28,629 --> 01:10:30,129
Where's your kid?

901
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:31,762
And where's yours?

902
01:10:36,494 --> 01:10:38,160
He'll break his neck.

903
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:40,127
He'll be fine.

904
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,126
Let him run around and enjoy nature.
There are no animals here.

905
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:46,858
Man is the most dangerous animal.

906
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:49,591
- None of those here either.
- Well, we're here.

907
01:10:49,725 --> 01:10:53,190
- You calling yourself a man?
- Get a handle on your woman, Pasha.

908
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,024
Too late now.

909
01:10:57,456 --> 01:10:58,789
Mummy!

910
01:11:00,822 --> 01:11:02,355
What happened, Vitya?

911
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:05,188
That man is choking Lilya.

912
01:11:05,288 --> 01:11:06,921
Roma saw it and started crying.

913
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,153
What are you talking about? What man?

914
01:11:09,253 --> 01:11:11,153
The handsome one from Moscow.

915
01:11:18,085 --> 01:11:19,318
You coppers

916
01:11:19,418 --> 01:11:21,784
just gonna wait
for the mayhem to start?

917
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:24,517
Mum, what's "mayhem"?

918
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,049
- You'll know when you're older.
- I want to know now.

919
01:11:29,183 --> 01:11:31,682
Let's put that gun away

920
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,782
from harm.

921
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:40,647
Mum, what's "harm"?

922
01:11:40,747 --> 01:11:44,313
Stop annoying me.
Remember when you set the cat on fire?

923
01:11:44,913 --> 01:11:48,412
- Yeah. Who did it this time?
- Nobody.

924
01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:51,544
- Then where's the harm?
- Knock it off.

925
01:11:53,211 --> 01:11:54,577
Oh, God...

926
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,577
You've got too anxious, Vadim.

927
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:01,976
Worrying yourself and others
over nothing.

928
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:04,142
As if you don't know

929
01:12:04,242 --> 01:12:07,574
we're all in God's hands.
It's His will.

930
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:10,674
Of course I know, Father.

931
01:12:10,807 --> 01:12:12,440
So what troubles you?

932
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:15,173
Is your faith wavering?

933
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:18,538
Do you take communion?
Go to confession?

934
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:22,171
Every Sunday, without fail.

935
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:24,404
I try to.

936
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:28,436
Of course I can't always make it.
I get so busy...

937
01:12:28,536 --> 01:12:30,070
But I try.

938
01:12:31,203 --> 01:12:33,302
Who's your confessor?

939
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:41,001
Our local priest,
the one you referred me to.

940
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:42,567
Father Alexei?

941
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,067
That's the one.

942
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,166
He's a good priest.

943
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:49,432
Seems OK.

944
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,965
Get a hold of yourself, Vadim.

945
01:12:53,065 --> 01:12:56,198
And don't worry,
you are doing God's work.

946
01:12:56,864 --> 01:12:59,497
It is said
that good deeds are done

947
01:12:59,597 --> 01:13:01,829
happily and with ease,

948
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:04,529
but don't forget

949
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:07,761
the enemy is ever ready
and does not sleep.

950
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:09,627
That's the thing.

951
01:13:09,727 --> 01:13:11,794
You know...

952
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:14,694
It's like everything is going wrong.

953
01:13:15,926 --> 01:13:16,659
I'm uneasy.

954
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:18,159
I'm uneasy.

955
01:13:18,893 --> 01:13:19,992
What's happened is...

956
01:13:20,092 --> 01:13:23,492
Don't reveal anything to me.
You're not at confession.

957
01:13:25,324 --> 01:13:27,491
You and I may be working

958
01:13:28,023 --> 01:13:29,657
for the same cause.

959
01:13:30,223 --> 01:13:34,222
But you've got your territory,
and I've got mine.

960
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:36,322
I understand that.

961
01:13:39,088 --> 01:13:41,154
I just feel ill at ease...

962
01:13:42,154 --> 01:13:46,020
I told you a couple of days ago,
and I'll tell you again:

963
01:13:46,153 --> 01:13:48,319
all power is from God.

964
01:13:48,886 --> 01:13:51,252
Where there's power, there's might.

965
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:55,351
If you hold power in your territory,

966
01:13:56,017 --> 01:14:00,184
solve your issues yourself,
with your might.

967
01:14:00,316 --> 01:14:03,116
Don't go looking for help,

968
01:14:03,216 --> 01:14:05,815
or the enemy will think
you are weak.

969
01:14:08,715 --> 01:14:11,748
Honestly, I have to lecture you
like a child.

970
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:12,881
Vadim...

971
01:14:14,313 --> 01:14:16,180
I don't recognise you like this.

972
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,479
Everything OK with the wife?

973
01:14:21,346 --> 01:14:22,912
I think so.

974
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:24,445
How are the kids?

975
01:14:25,178 --> 01:14:26,744
They're fine.

976
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,477
You're not sick?

977
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,609
No.

978
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,608
That's a blessing.

979
01:14:50,606 --> 01:14:52,372
God bless you.

980
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:53,326
It's all my fault.

981
01:15:53,459 --> 01:15:55,359
No such thing.

982
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:58,858
Each of us is guilty
of our own faults.

983
01:16:00,124 --> 01:16:02,324
Everything is everyone's fault.

984
01:16:04,157 --> 01:16:06,656
Even if we confess,

985
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:10,056
the law doesn't hold it
to be a proof of guilt.

986
01:16:12,022 --> 01:16:15,021
We're innocent until proven guilty.

987
01:16:19,186 --> 01:16:22,353
But who's going to prove anything?
And to whom?

988
01:16:26,352 --> 01:16:28,118
Do you believe in God?

989
01:16:29,784 --> 01:16:32,251
Why do you all keep
asking me about God?

990
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:33,883
I believe in facts.

991
01:16:34,017 --> 01:16:35,850
I'm a lawyer, Lilya.

992
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:47,947
Don't. Please.

993
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,647
No confessions.

994
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:59,011
Because there's no proof?

995
01:17:01,444 --> 01:17:03,077
And there won't be any.

996
01:17:10,643 --> 01:17:12,775
Will you come with me?

997
01:17:20,707 --> 01:17:23,106
I don't understand you.

998
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:27,005
I don't understand myself.

999
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:12,262
I'd love to run away
with someone too.

1000
01:18:13,562 --> 01:18:15,061
Women are dumb.

1001
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:18,161
Why?

1002
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:22,427
Because you can't run away
from yourself.

1003
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,926
Maybe not,

1004
01:18:25,059 --> 01:18:27,826
but I sure can run away from you.

1005
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:32,358
Where to?

1006
01:18:33,725 --> 01:18:35,457
To whore around in Moscow?

1007
01:18:35,557 --> 01:18:37,590
- Why "whore around"?
- Because you're a whore.

1008
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:42,955
See that?

1009
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:44,255
Want me to smack you too?

1010
01:18:44,389 --> 01:18:45,455
What?

1011
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:49,121
You guys can't take a joke?

1012
01:18:50,987 --> 01:18:55,153
I think I'd run
all the way to America.

1013
01:18:56,086 --> 01:18:58,819
Great. Why not the moon?

1014
01:18:58,952 --> 01:19:01,551
Are you asking for another slap?

1015
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:05,418
Are the boys asleep?

1016
01:19:06,018 --> 01:19:07,417
Yeah.

1017
01:19:09,217 --> 01:19:10,949
Roma...

1018
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,549
he's...

1019
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:15,982
depressed.

1020
01:19:16,515 --> 01:19:18,215
That's understandable.

1021
01:19:19,647 --> 01:19:21,614
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1022
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:23,880
Kolya,

1023
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,380
don't drink so much again.

1024
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:31,578
Roma's traumatised enough as it is.

1025
01:19:32,078 --> 01:19:33,544
I won't.

1026
01:19:35,911 --> 01:19:36,944
Good.

1027
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:59,306
She's back.

1028
01:20:00,972 --> 01:20:03,838
- Thank God.
- Maybe she's getting her things.

1029
01:20:04,605 --> 01:20:08,737
Shut up, Pasha. Go get Vitya.

1030
01:20:10,904 --> 01:20:12,670
Are you OK to drive?

1031
01:20:14,169 --> 01:20:15,902
I'm a traffic cop, aren't I?

1032
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:37,764
Vitya...

1033
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:49,495
Well, we'll be off.

1034
01:20:50,628 --> 01:20:52,461
So just, you know...

1035
01:21:24,354 --> 01:21:25,554
Kolya...

1036
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:39,951
Do you want a child?

1037
01:22:12,877 --> 01:22:15,043
Hello? Yes, Vadim.

1038
01:22:16,176 --> 01:22:17,843
Yes, I recognised you.

1039
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:23,841
Sure, let's meet.

1040
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:27,340
I'm at the hotel.

1041
01:22:30,873 --> 01:22:32,639
Half an hour is good.

1042
01:22:46,370 --> 01:22:48,070
Can I see those?

1043
01:22:48,202 --> 01:22:49,402
These?

1044
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:55,834
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

1045
01:23:22,262 --> 01:23:24,162
Well, get in.

1046
01:23:24,962 --> 01:23:27,394
I won't bite. Come on!

1047
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:29,293
You're a tough guy.

1048
01:23:29,393 --> 01:23:30,860
If I'm not back here in two hours...

1049
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,093
You will be, don't worry.

1050
01:23:44,424 --> 01:23:46,223
Rough night?

1051
01:23:46,357 --> 01:23:48,023
You're all puffy.

1052
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,823
Where are we going?

1053
01:23:49,923 --> 01:23:51,856
You'll see.

1054
01:23:51,956 --> 01:23:53,722
You'll like it.

1055
01:23:53,822 --> 01:23:55,588
We'll sit and talk things over.

1056
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:56,755
What things?

1057
01:23:56,888 --> 01:24:00,354
What do you mean?
You want money, right?

1058
01:24:01,387 --> 01:24:03,020
And I want guarantees.

1059
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,619
Guarantees of what?

1060
01:24:04,753 --> 01:24:07,219
See, we're already talking.

1061
01:24:10,285 --> 01:24:13,384
Just a quick tete-a-tete, you know.

1062
01:25:36,066 --> 01:25:37,099
So,

1063
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,399
how does it feel?

1064
01:25:41,498 --> 01:25:43,332
Why did you hit him in the face?

1065
01:25:43,898 --> 01:25:44,898
Although...

1066
01:25:45,031 --> 01:25:46,031
Ruslan!

1067
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:49,163
Nothing to say?

1068
01:25:51,763 --> 01:25:54,729
No last words? No?

1069
01:25:56,995 --> 01:26:00,528
Not even a few
for your daughter maybe?

1070
01:26:01,628 --> 01:26:03,594
- What?
- That's enough.

1071
01:26:03,694 --> 01:26:06,827
Fine. We'll honour your last wish.

1072
01:26:46,318 --> 01:26:49,217
A public-private partnership.

1073
01:26:49,284 --> 01:26:51,150
A spot with great potential.

1074
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:54,183
Close to the centre, by the sea.

1075
01:26:56,282 --> 01:26:57,648
I'm very happy,

1076
01:26:58,082 --> 01:27:00,815
because this is a brand of sorts.

1077
01:27:00,948 --> 01:27:02,847
I mean, your brand.

1078
01:27:02,947 --> 01:27:07,646
And people trust brands these days.
Officials hold high hopes for them.

1079
01:27:11,745 --> 01:27:15,445
The main thing now is
to keep the momentum.

1080
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:20,477
The desire to make headway,
to work and move things forward.

1081
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,442
I'll send my guy over today.

1082
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:27,909
No, no, today.

1083
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:29,741
It's a deal then.

1084
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,473
What do you mean, "crystal"?

1085
01:27:41,239 --> 01:27:43,339
That's your problem.

1086
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,805
I told you loud and clear:
you get going, whatever it takes.

1087
01:27:46,905 --> 01:27:50,937
If you can't get going,
we'll find someone who can.

1088
01:27:52,104 --> 01:27:53,336
All right, back to work.

1089
01:32:27,044 --> 01:32:28,677
So, how??™s Kolya?

1090
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:31,044
He threatened to kill you both.

1091
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:33,876
Then had a few drinks
and calmed down.

1092
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,675
He loves you.

1093
01:32:41,941 --> 01:32:43,441
What about the other one?

1094
01:32:45,107 --> 01:32:47,007
Did he ask you to go to Moscow?

1095
01:35:56,732 --> 01:35:58,532
OK, fine.

1096
01:35:59,065 --> 01:36:01,964
Come pick it up.
But make it quick, OK?

1097
01:36:12,162 --> 01:36:14,462
He's taking the boat tomorrow.

1098
01:36:20,227 --> 01:36:22,494
I'm selling it all off for nothing.

1099
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:32,424
If that bastard builds himself
a palace here, I'll burn it down.

1100
01:36:34,424 --> 01:36:36,223
Hey, wandering spirit!

1101
01:36:37,823 --> 01:36:39,856
Why did you leave your phone?

1102
01:36:43,322 --> 01:36:44,422
Roma!

1103
01:37:07,384 --> 01:37:08,384
Listen...

1104
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:09,850
What do you want?

1105
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:13,649
You ruined everything!
It's all because of you!

1106
01:37:13,715 --> 01:37:15,015
I hate you!

1107
01:37:15,182 --> 01:37:16,682
What is it, Roma?

1108
01:37:17,215 --> 01:37:20,314
I don't want to live with you
anymore! I'm sick of you!

1109
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:21,681
Son, calm down.

1110
01:37:21,847 --> 01:37:24,613
- Stay away from me!
- Stop it...

1111
01:37:25,313 --> 01:37:26,746
What's with you?

1112
01:37:29,512 --> 01:37:30,979
Get her out of here, Dad!

1113
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:32,545
Get out!

1114
01:37:33,745 --> 01:37:35,011
Dad...

1115
01:37:36,644 --> 01:37:39,077
It's going to be OK.

1116
01:40:54,168 --> 01:40:55,667
What?

1117
01:40:55,801 --> 01:40:57,900
Forgive her. She's...

1118
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:02,366
She's a good person.

1119
01:41:02,499 --> 01:41:04,665
Have you forgiven her?

1120
01:41:04,765 --> 01:41:06,165
I'm trying.

1121
01:41:09,364 --> 01:41:11,131
OK, better get going.

1122
01:41:37,492 --> 01:41:39,425
Put it down here.

1123
01:41:48,656 --> 01:41:49,689
Hey.

1124
01:41:49,856 --> 01:41:51,722
- Where's Lilya?
- She didn't come today.

1125
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:54,088
- What?
- I'm serious.

1126
01:41:56,354 --> 01:41:59,054
I tried calling her too -
says "number unavailable".

1127
01:41:59,154 --> 01:42:01,020
Isn't she home?

1128
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,753
Number unavailable.

1129
01:42:03,853 --> 01:42:05,752
OK, I??™ll be off.

1130
01:42:06,852 --> 01:42:08,352
Can you give me a lift?

1131
01:42:08,851 --> 01:42:11,251
- What?
- Can I get a lift?

1132
01:42:11,351 --> 01:42:13,351
Oh, sure, get in.

1133
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:23,722
She ran off to him. To Moscow.

1134
01:44:23,822 --> 01:44:26,022
I don't doubt it for a second.

1135
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:30,421
What else could have happened?

1136
01:44:30,521 --> 01:44:33,654
Anything. Do you know
how many people go missing?

1137
01:44:33,787 --> 01:44:35,553
I don't believe in "anything".

1138
01:44:35,653 --> 01:44:37,487
What about the cops?

1139
01:44:38,186 --> 01:44:39,519
What about them?

1140
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:42,418
Have to wait three days.

1141
01:44:42,518 --> 01:44:43,885
That's a bunch of shit.

1142
01:44:43,985 --> 01:44:45,518
You can report it right away.

1143
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:49,784
Take it from the wife
of a law enforcement officer.

1144
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:51,050
OK,

1145
01:44:51,550 --> 01:44:54,116
I go to the cops and tell them what?

1146
01:44:54,249 --> 01:44:57,282
"My wife ran off to Moscow
to her lover.

1147
01:44:57,415 --> 01:45:01,614
"Here's her name and number.
Get her back."

1148
01:45:02,481 --> 01:45:05,147
Hey, if you want,
I can call him right now.

1149
01:45:05,547 --> 01:45:07,213
I already tried over and over.

1150
01:45:07,313 --> 01:45:08,480
And?

1151
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:10,646
Nothing. No answer.

1152
01:45:11,312 --> 01:45:13,345
We have to do something.

1153
01:45:20,477 --> 01:45:21,943
And I wouldn't be surprised

1154
01:45:22,077 --> 01:45:26,409
if he took my money
from that bastard and bailed.

1155
01:45:26,509 --> 01:45:28,775
And she joined him later.

1156
01:46:33,828 --> 01:46:35,327
Hi, Kolya.

1157
01:46:36,527 --> 01:46:37,661
Where's Roma?

1158
01:46:37,827 --> 01:46:39,593
He went home.

1159
01:46:40,493 --> 01:46:43,292
- When?
- About 20 minutes ago.

1160
01:47:45,212 --> 01:47:46,946
Get the door!

1161
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:15,072
They found her.

1162
01:49:29,923 --> 01:49:31,623
Move away.

1163
01:49:32,656 --> 01:49:34,189
Come on.

1164
01:50:10,615 --> 01:50:11,881
Why?

1165
01:50:16,746 --> 01:50:18,646
Why, Lord?

1166
01:50:58,404 --> 01:50:59,570
What can I get you, Kolya?

1167
01:50:59,704 --> 01:51:01,936
Vodka, what else? 2 bottles.

1168
01:51:10,334 --> 01:51:11,801
Hello, Kolya.

1169
01:51:12,534 --> 01:51:14,434
Hey, Father Vasily.

1170
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:46,894
Well?

1171
01:51:48,726 --> 01:51:50,226
Where's your...

1172
01:51:50,359 --> 01:51:53,392
merciful God Almighty?

1173
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,892
Mine is with me.

1174
01:51:57,424 --> 01:51:59,457
As for yours, I wouldn't know.

1175
01:52:01,323 --> 01:52:03,257
Who do you pray to?

1176
01:52:04,756 --> 01:52:06,989
Haven't seen you in church.

1177
01:52:08,622 --> 01:52:11,321
You don't fast, take communion
or go to confession.

1178
01:52:11,421 --> 01:52:15,554
If I lit candles and all,
would things be different?

1179
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:18,520
Maybe it's not too late to start?

1180
01:52:19,153 --> 01:52:21,386
Would I get my wife
back from the dead?

1181
01:52:21,519 --> 01:52:23,352
And my house?

1182
01:52:23,752 --> 01:52:25,485
Or is it too late?

1183
01:52:26,185 --> 01:52:27,418
I don't know.

1184
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:29,951
Our Lord moves in mysterious ways.

1185
01:52:30,051 --> 01:52:31,817
You don't know?

1186
01:52:31,917 --> 01:52:35,583
Then why do you call me
to confession?

1187
01:52:37,283 --> 01:52:38,982
What do you know then?

1188
01:52:39,149 --> 01:52:41,215
- Want some?
- No.

1189
01:52:45,814 --> 01:52:48,647
"Can you pull in Leviathan
with a fishhook

1190
01:52:49,380 --> 01:52:52,080
"or tie down its tongue with a rope?

1191
01:52:52,712 --> 01:52:55,279
"Will it keep begging you for mercy?

1192
01:52:55,379 --> 01:52:58,711
"Will it speak to you
with gentle words?

1193
01:52:59,245 --> 01:53:01,678
"Nothing on earth is its equal.

1194
01:53:02,377 --> 01:53:04,510
"It is king over all that are proud."

1195
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:06,109
Father Vasily...

1196
01:53:07,309 --> 01:53:09,842
I'm talking to you
as a regular person.

1197
01:53:09,976 --> 01:53:12,075
Why the fucking riddles?

1198
01:53:12,175 --> 01:53:13,708
What for?

1199
01:53:13,841 --> 01:53:16,741
Have you heard of a man called Job?

1200
01:53:17,174 --> 01:53:20,673
Like you, he was preoccupied
with the meaning of life.

1201
01:53:20,806 --> 01:53:23,506
"Why?" he asked.
"Why me of all people?"

1202
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:26,772
He worried so much
he became covered with scabs.

1203
01:53:26,872 --> 01:53:30,671
His wife tried to talk some sense
into him; his friends told him

1204
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:32,804
to not evoke God's anger.

1205
01:53:32,904 --> 01:53:36,770
But he kept kicking up dust
and sprinkling ash on his head.

1206
01:53:36,836 --> 01:53:39,736
Then the Lord relented

1207
01:53:39,869 --> 01:53:41,335
and appeared to him

1208
01:53:41,469 --> 01:53:43,469
in the form of a hurricane

1209
01:53:43,601 --> 01:53:46,734
and explained everything to him
in pictures.

1210
01:53:46,901 --> 01:53:48,034
And?

1211
01:53:48,534 --> 01:53:50,767
Job resigned himself to his fate

1212
01:53:50,867 --> 01:53:53,333
and lived to be 140.

1213
01:53:53,433 --> 01:53:57,466
Got to see 4 generations
of his family

1214
01:53:58,098 --> 01:54:00,198
and died old

1215
01:54:00,331 --> 01:54:01,497
and content.

1216
01:54:01,631 --> 01:54:03,164
Is that a fairy tale?

1217
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:07,996
No,

1218
01:54:08,396 --> 01:54:10,429
it's in the Bible.

1219
01:54:10,563 --> 01:54:13,695
Let me help you carry that.
Come on.

1220
01:54:26,359 --> 01:54:27,592
Thanks.

1221
01:54:29,525 --> 01:54:33,258
The funeral service is tomorrow.
They just called.

1222
01:54:47,655 --> 01:54:49,754
Yulia, there's some bread for you.

1223
01:54:49,887 --> 01:54:51,154
God bless you.

1224
01:54:51,287 --> 01:54:53,586
Glory be to God. Eat up.

1225
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:11,250
How terrible...

1226
01:55:15,815 --> 01:55:18,681
Do you think she did this herself?

1227
01:55:19,348 --> 01:55:21,147
The forensic tests will tell.

1228
01:55:27,946 --> 01:55:29,346
Remember

1229
01:55:30,212 --> 01:55:32,845
how Kolya threatened to kill her?

1230
01:55:32,978 --> 01:55:35,377
- Come on now.
- He did.

1231
01:55:35,544 --> 01:55:37,777
- So what?
- He could have done it.

1232
01:55:37,877 --> 01:55:40,210
He's capable, I swear.

1233
01:55:41,376 --> 01:55:43,009
- You hear me?
- What the hell?

1234
01:55:43,143 --> 01:55:45,475
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

1235
01:55:45,575 --> 01:55:48,442
- And?
- You're the cop. You tell me.

1236
01:55:50,174 --> 01:55:51,974
Use your brain.

1237
01:56:13,469 --> 01:56:14,602
Dad...

1238
01:56:16,735 --> 01:56:18,268
Will you ever stop drinking?

1239
01:56:18,368 --> 01:56:19,568
I will.

1240
01:56:20,635 --> 01:56:23,934
I'm quitting tomorrow.
You believe me?

1241
01:56:27,466 --> 01:56:28,766
Son...

1242
01:56:31,532 --> 01:56:34,164
Sit. Let's talk.

1243
01:56:34,298 --> 01:56:36,498
Forget it. I'm going out.

1244
01:56:45,162 --> 01:56:46,562
All right.

1245
01:56:50,594 --> 01:56:51,794
Go.

1246
01:56:59,793 --> 01:57:02,958
- Hello.
- Hi. Is your dad home?

1247
01:57:03,092 --> 01:57:05,258
- He's asleep.
- I see.

1248
01:57:05,725 --> 01:57:07,424
- Hey, where are you going?
- Easy, easy.

1249
01:57:07,557 --> 01:57:10,190
- Dad! Some guys just barged in!
- Sit down and be quiet.

1250
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:12,156
- What?
- Sit down, I said.

1251
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:15,123
Get up. Homicide department.

1252
01:57:15,256 --> 01:57:17,455
You ignored the court order.

1253
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:19,288
What court order?

1254
01:57:19,822 --> 01:57:21,121
This one.

1255
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,120
Roma!

1256
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:29,752
Sit down!

1257
01:57:46,616 --> 01:57:47,816
Dad!

1258
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:14,410
We have every reason to believe
you killed your wife

1259
01:58:14,543 --> 01:58:16,610
and then faked her drowning.

1260
01:58:17,476 --> 01:58:18,509
What?

1261
01:58:20,275 --> 01:58:21,275
Are you crazy?

1262
01:58:23,174 --> 01:58:25,308
We discovered signs of violence
on the body.

1263
01:58:25,374 --> 01:58:27,773
She was murdered,
then pushed into the water.

1264
01:58:27,907 --> 01:58:30,606
She died from a blow
with a blunt object

1265
01:58:30,739 --> 01:58:32,839
to the back of her head.

1266
01:58:32,939 --> 01:58:36,405
Not long before that,
she had sexual intercourse.

1267
01:58:36,538 --> 01:58:39,671
The investigation is looking
into the possibility of rape.

1268
01:58:40,504 --> 01:58:43,437
We'll take your sperm for tests.
Something tells me

1269
01:58:43,604 --> 01:58:45,670
it will be a match.

1270
01:58:46,969 --> 01:58:48,303
Next,

1271
01:58:49,435 --> 01:58:53,468
we have testimony
from Angela Polivanova

1272
01:58:54,668 --> 01:58:58,001
and her husband, Pasha Polivanov

1273
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,232
to the effect that a few days
prior to the murder,

1274
01:59:02,366 --> 01:59:04,132
while at a picnic,

1275
01:59:04,266 --> 01:59:06,731
you had a fight with your wife

1276
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:09,265
and her lover in front of witnesses.

1277
01:59:09,398 --> 01:59:11,798
after you caught them having sex.

1278
01:59:11,964 --> 01:59:14,163
You beat up the lover,

1279
01:59:14,297 --> 01:59:15,663
a man called Dmitri,

1280
01:59:16,197 --> 01:59:18,063
whose identity
is currently being established,

1281
01:59:18,163 --> 01:59:22,195
then hit your wife, and afterwards
threatened to kill them both.

1282
01:59:22,828 --> 01:59:24,961
This testimony was confirmed

1283
01:59:26,261 --> 01:59:28,360
by Ivan Stepanych Degtyaryev,

1284
01:59:29,094 --> 01:59:31,760
Lieutenant Colonel
of the traffic police,

1285
01:59:31,926 --> 01:59:35,159
who was also present.

1286
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:39,524
In addition,
the suspected murder weapon,

1287
01:59:39,624 --> 01:59:43,324
a hammer with the shape matching
that of the Victim's head wound,

1288
01:59:44,191 --> 01:59:48,790
was found in a building
on your property.

1289
01:59:48,922 --> 01:59:50,922
It has been taken for testing.

1290
01:59:51,389 --> 01:59:54,255
Would you like to comment
on any of this?

1291
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:58,320
Personally, I would advise you

1292
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:00,820
to write a full confession.

1293
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:03,186
We have more than enough evidence.

1294
02:00:03,286 --> 02:00:06,052
A confession may reduce the sentence.

1295
02:00:06,552 --> 02:00:08,752
Pursuant to Article 105 Part 1,

1296
02:00:09,252 --> 02:00:12,384
you'll get up to 15 years

1297
02:00:12,484 --> 02:00:14,950
unless there are
aggravating circumstances,

1298
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:18,150
in which case,
it'll be up to 20 years.

1299
02:00:21,183 --> 02:00:22,549
Right...

1300
02:00:23,482 --> 02:00:26,381
In any case,
we're detaining you for 48 hours

1301
02:00:26,481 --> 02:00:28,481
as a murder suspect.

1302
02:00:29,481 --> 02:00:32,647
I'll petition the court
for a warrant for your arrest

1303
02:00:32,780 --> 02:00:37,845
as a flight risk and as someone
who might impede the investigation.

1304
02:00:44,744 --> 02:00:45,944
Also...

1305
02:00:46,510 --> 02:00:49,409
you have the right to a lawyer.

1306
02:00:49,543 --> 02:00:51,909
If you don't have a lawyer,

1307
02:00:52,009 --> 02:00:54,075
the state will appoint one for you.

1308
02:00:54,975 --> 02:00:56,641
Do you understand?

1309
02:00:59,941 --> 02:01:02,107
I don't understand any of this.

1310
02:01:02,874 --> 02:01:05,106
You'll have plenty of time
to think it over.

1311
02:01:54,729 --> 02:01:56,695
- Hello.
- Just one?

1312
02:01:56,795 --> 02:01:58,228
Just one.

1313
02:02:03,127 --> 02:02:04,327
Listen...

1314
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,192
My son's left all alone.

1315
02:02:10,459 --> 02:02:11,891
We've got no relatives.

1316
02:02:12,025 --> 02:02:13,425
Don't shit yourself.

1317
02:02:14,125 --> 02:02:16,290
The state will take care of him.

1318
02:03:12,678 --> 02:03:15,378
Roma, open up.
It's Angela and Pasha.

1319
02:03:15,511 --> 02:03:17,077
Are you alone?

1320
02:03:17,177 --> 02:03:18,344
Yes, it's just us.

1321
02:03:24,276 --> 02:03:25,743
How are you?

1322
02:03:26,243 --> 02:03:27,575
I'm all right.

1323
02:03:28,242 --> 02:03:31,341
Why didn't you call me
when they took your dad?

1324
02:03:32,274 --> 02:03:34,174
I don't have your number.

1325
02:03:36,907 --> 02:03:39,106
How long have you
been here alone?

1326
02:03:39,240 --> 02:03:40,440
I don't know.

1327
02:03:41,306 --> 02:03:43,372
5 days, I think.

1328
02:03:44,705 --> 02:03:45,905
Roma...

1329
02:03:47,338 --> 02:03:49,338
A lawyer called.

1330
02:03:50,437 --> 02:03:53,137
Your dad was accused
of murdering Lilya.

1331
02:03:54,037 --> 02:03:58,136
He'll be in jail till the trial.
Then, they'll take him to prison.

1332
02:03:59,368 --> 02:04:01,135
They have proof.

1333
02:04:01,235 --> 02:04:02,601
That's not true.

1334
02:04:02,701 --> 02:04:04,634
Why would I lie to you?

1335
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:10,166
Why didn't he call me?
They must let him call me.

1336
02:04:10,266 --> 02:04:11,866
Look, Roma,

1337
02:04:12,665 --> 02:04:15,865
the lawyer said that
if there's no one to take care of you,

1338
02:04:15,965 --> 02:04:17,664
they'll put you in an orphanage.

1339
02:04:18,498 --> 02:04:20,597
I can take care of myself.

1340
02:04:20,697 --> 02:04:23,730
By law, until you turn 18,

1341
02:04:23,863 --> 02:04:27,196
you must live
in an orphanage or with a guardian.

1342
02:04:28,129 --> 02:04:30,329
Pasha and I talked it over...

1343
02:04:30,961 --> 02:04:33,261
We'd like to be your guardians.

1344
02:04:33,361 --> 02:04:35,260
You've got no one else, right?

1345
02:04:41,326 --> 02:04:42,726
Is it because of the money?

1346
02:04:43,326 --> 02:04:44,658
What money?

1347
02:04:44,758 --> 02:04:46,458
Won't you get paid for it?

1348
02:04:46,558 --> 02:04:48,358
How should I know?

1349
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:53,324
But if you agree,
I'll definitely find out.

1350
02:04:53,457 --> 02:04:56,423
I guess the state
would probably help out,

1351
02:04:57,123 --> 02:04:59,155
but that's not why we're offering.

1352
02:04:59,722 --> 02:05:01,355
Why then?

1353
02:05:02,522 --> 02:05:03,888
I don't know.

1354
02:05:05,221 --> 02:05:06,521
You're like...

1355
02:05:07,221 --> 02:05:08,753
family to us.

1356
02:05:09,453 --> 02:05:11,086
Your mum and I were friends.

1357
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:14,252
You were little when she died.

1358
02:05:15,585 --> 02:05:19,684
I went to school with your parents.
And Lilya. She was a bit younger.

1359
02:05:31,648 --> 02:05:33,282
I'll step out for a smoke.

1360
02:07:33,122 --> 02:07:36,189
Pribrezhny Town Court
has ruled as follows:

1361
02:07:36,321 --> 02:07:39,921
The Panel of Judges,

1362
02:07:40,021 --> 02:07:45,587
presided over by Mrs Tarasova,
examined Mr Sergeyev's petition

1363
02:07:45,687 --> 02:07:48,619
to appeal the ruling
on case No. 06-18.

1364
02:07:48,752 --> 02:07:52,518
In the presence of Mr Sergeyev,
the court has determined that:

1365
02:07:52,651 --> 02:07:55,484
Mr Sergeyev,
who has no previous convictions,

1366
02:07:55,617 --> 02:07:58,984
is convicted in accordance
with Article 105 of the Criminal Code

1367
02:07:59,084 --> 02:08:02,649
and sentenced to 15 years
in a maximum-security penitentiary.

1368
02:08:02,783 --> 02:08:05,549
The ruling also addressed
evidence in the case:

1369
02:08:05,649 --> 02:08:10,281
Mr Sergeyev was convicted
of premeditated murder of his wife.

1370
02:08:10,381 --> 02:08:14,080
The circumstances of the crime
are outlined in the ruling.

1371
02:08:14,180 --> 02:08:16,713
Mr Sergeyev refused
to confess to the crime.

1372
02:08:16,846 --> 02:08:21,279
He filed an appeal requesting
that the ruling be repealed.

1373
02:08:21,379 --> 02:08:25,478
Mr Sergeyev claims that his guilt
in the case was not proven.

1374
02:08:25,611 --> 02:08:30,543
The court considers the ruling
not subject to repeal.

1375
02:08:30,977 --> 02:08:34,176
All circumstances
were thoroughly examined by the court

1376
02:08:34,309 --> 02:08:36,508
and all evidence
given due consideration.

1377
02:08:36,642 --> 02:08:40,175
The defendant's claim of innocence
was reviewed by the court

1378
02:08:40,307 --> 02:08:41,507
and soundly rejected.

1379
02:09:03,003 --> 02:09:04,302
Hello?

1380
02:09:08,769 --> 02:09:10,401
15 years?

1381
02:09:10,535 --> 02:09:12,301
Well, thank God.

1382
02:09:12,434 --> 02:09:15,067
That'll teach him to know his place.

1383
02:09:16,467 --> 02:09:18,266
Yeah, later.

1384
02:09:24,198 --> 02:09:25,631
One more.

1385
02:09:45,193 --> 02:09:50,360
We probably don't even realise yet
what is really happening.

1386
02:09:51,126 --> 02:09:53,492
We are reawakening

1387
02:09:54,292 --> 02:09:56,725
the soul of the Russian people.

1388
02:09:57,758 --> 02:10:02,623
As the Great Prince
St. Alexander Nevsky

1389
02:10:02,757 --> 02:10:05,056
wonderfully put it:

1390
02:10:05,156 --> 02:10:08,856
"God dwells not in strength,
but in truth."

1391
02:10:08,956 --> 02:10:12,721
And he was right:
not with strength, but with love;

1392
02:10:12,821 --> 02:10:14,554
not with cunning,

1393
02:10:14,654 --> 02:10:16,920
but with the Lord's wisdom;

1394
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:20,186
not with anger and hatred,
but with bravery

1395
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:24,719
have we overcome the many enemies
of our faith and our Motherland.

1396
02:10:25,818 --> 02:10:29,051
But the most important thing today

1397
02:10:29,884 --> 02:10:32,251
is that we must

1398
02:10:32,383 --> 02:10:34,450
uphold the Orthodox faith

1399
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:36,750
and always speak truthfully.

1400
02:10:37,249 --> 02:10:38,782
Truth

1401
02:10:38,915 --> 02:10:41,381
is God's legacy.

1402
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:46,180
Truth reflects the world
as it really is, without distortion.

1403
02:10:46,914 --> 02:10:52,046
But only he who knows God's truth
can find truth.

1404
02:10:52,146 --> 02:10:55,945
And God's truth
is Christ Himself.

1405
02:10:56,078 --> 02:10:58,578
This is why, when Apostle Paul said,

1406
02:10:58,678 --> 02:11:02,110
"I no longer live,
but Christ lives in me"

1407
02:11:03,310 --> 02:11:07,143
he meant that when a man
lets Christ into his soul -

1408
02:11:07,843 --> 02:11:10,275
in other words,
begins to think like Christ,

1409
02:11:10,375 --> 02:11:12,042
see like Christ

1410
02:11:12,142 --> 02:11:15,374
and act like the Lord commanded -

1411
02:11:15,474 --> 02:11:19,807
only then does this man
possess truth.

1412
02:11:20,506 --> 02:11:23,072
And that means he can regard events

1413
02:11:23,972 --> 02:11:26,272
and see their true meaning

1414
02:11:26,372 --> 02:11:29,671
and tell good from evil.

1415
02:11:29,804 --> 02:11:33,170
And that is the essence of truth.

1416
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:37,336
When people destroy crosses,

1417
02:11:37,403 --> 02:11:41,268
break icons, defile the Crucifix

1418
02:11:42,202 --> 02:11:45,201
and blaspheme by calling
demonic rites a prayer,

1419
02:11:45,335 --> 02:11:48,167
when people try to convince others

1420
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,266
that they do this
out of good intentions,

1421
02:11:51,366 --> 02:11:53,099
they are passing off lies

1422
02:11:53,233 --> 02:11:55,565
as the truth.

1423
02:11:55,665 --> 02:11:57,432
How can one

1424
02:11:57,565 --> 02:12:01,398
preach freedom
while destroying the foundations

1425
02:12:01,498 --> 02:12:03,564
of morality?

1426
02:12:03,664 --> 02:12:07,463
Freedom is finding God's truth.

1427
02:12:07,596 --> 02:12:10,262
The Bible teaches us this.

1428
02:12:10,396 --> 02:12:14,428
Know God's truth,
and it shall set you free.

1429
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:20,394
Only man who knows God's truth,
who lives by it,

1430
02:12:20,494 --> 02:12:22,459
who defends it -

1431
02:12:22,559 --> 02:12:25,093
only that man is truly free.

1432
02:12:26,326 --> 02:12:30,791
My beloved brothers and sisters
in Christ!

1433
02:12:30,925 --> 02:12:36,390
The world today is constantly
changing its reference points.

1434
02:12:37,024 --> 02:12:39,523
True values

1435
02:12:40,056 --> 02:12:42,255
are being replaced with false ones.

1436
02:12:42,389 --> 02:12:45,622
But even in this world,

1437
02:12:46,554 --> 02:12:50,221
our path remains unchanged:
it leads to Christ.

1438
02:12:50,353 --> 02:12:54,420
We know that the Church
will protect and guide us

1439
02:12:54,553 --> 02:12:58,185
but the Church consists
of you and me.

1440
02:12:58,285 --> 02:12:59,819
God is with us.

1441
02:12:59,919 --> 02:13:02,718
Truth is with us.
The Lord's love is with us...

1442
02:13:04,318 --> 02:13:06,550
God sees everything, son.

1443
02:13:06,650 --> 02:13:11,482
And in defending our faith, we will
not liken ourselves to our enemies

1444
02:13:11,582 --> 02:13:13,116
but just as Christ

1445
02:13:13,249 --> 02:13:17,215
shed light on the truth
and unmasked the lies with one word,

1446
02:13:17,348 --> 02:13:20,880
so will we,
enlightened by the Church,

1447
02:13:21,414 --> 02:13:24,146
the World of God and saintly prayer

1448
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:26,413
defend the Orthodox faith.

1449
02:13:27,713 --> 02:13:30,045
I'm so glad
that you're pleased, sir.

1450
02:13:30,145 --> 02:13:32,344
Thanks a lot. We try.

1451
02:13:36,111 --> 02:13:39,510
It's not quite finished yet,
but it will be soon.

1452
02:13:40,276 --> 02:13:44,342
We'll do some landscaping,
maybe build a refectory.

1453
02:13:44,442 --> 02:13:47,341
As soon as it's all finished,
I'll call you right away.

1454
02:13:48,341 --> 02:13:51,307
- I have every faith in you.
- Thank you so much.

1455
02:13:52,007 --> 02:13:53,373
Where's my family?

1456
02:13:53,507 --> 02:13:55,807
Come on, sweetie, get in the car.
